Can’t get this working locally - only works on VS Code live server, I am guessing it’s due to using an audio file in preload.  

This was part of my final task submission for the Level 6 Creative Coding short course. It’s something I’d like to explore further.

This prototype is for the mixer game that will provide the background music to play synthesised notes over.
